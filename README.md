### Founder and Lightning Assignment

Implement Albums and Photos UI for the given APIs.  Every user has their own albums and on selecting the album they should be able to see the photos inside the album. There should be breadcrumbs to navigate back in the chronological order. You are free to design the UI as per your experience.
The user interface and design should be fully responsive, and code should be provided via a repository link.  You are free to use any frameworks or libraries that you wish.  Please also provide a README file detailing the steps taken to get the app up and running.
We appreciate that your time is valuable, so we donâ€™t want you to spend more than 4 hours on this exercise.  We're not necessarily looking for a complete solution, more a way for you to showcase your abilities, but we are looking for examples of best practices such as unit tests, clear structure, etc.
